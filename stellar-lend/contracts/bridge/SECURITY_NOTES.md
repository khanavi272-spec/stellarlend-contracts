# Security Notes — Bridge Validator Rotation

Threat model and mitigations

- Operator key compromise: Rotation requires a quorum proof signed by the *current* validator set. An operator private key compromise (single key) cannot rotate the set unless a quorum of current validators collude.
- Replay and downgrade: The `epoch` counter prevents accepting messages signed by retired validator sets (any signed_epoch < current epoch is rejected). Rotation requires epoch == current_epoch + 1, preventing out-of-order rotations.
- Signature binding: The proof signs the serialized tuple `(new_set_bytes_vec, epoch)`, binding the new validator set to the specific epoch.

Implementation notes

- Quorum: uses strict supermajority (floor(2n/3)+1). This should be chosen to match protocol requirements; adjust if BFT tolerance differs.
- Serialization: validators stored as `Vec<Vec<u8>>` (raw public key bytes) to ensure deterministic encoding and avoid cross-crate serde issues.
- Atomicity: `rotate_validators` performs proof verification before swapping validators and advancing the epoch.

Operational guidance

- Ensure secure key management for validator private keys and rotate keys off-channel when needed.
- When rotating, collect signatures from the current validator set over the exact payload — tooling should canonicalize key ordering and serialization before signing.
- Audit the on-chain representation to guarantee encoding matches the signing payload used by operator tooling.

Testing and coverage

- Unit tests cover quorum acceptance, insufficient quorum rejection, and epoch boundary enforcement.
- Before deployment, run integration tests and perform a security review comparing the on-chain encoding and off-chain signing tools.
