# Developer Glossary

This glossary defines key protocol terms, numeric scales, and common pitfalls for the StellarLend protocol.

## Protocol Terms

### Basis Points (BPS)
- **Definition**: A unit of measure for percentages in the protocol. 1 basis point = 0.01%.
- **Scale**: `10,000` = `100%`.
- **Usage**: Used for interest rates, collateral factors, liquidation thresholds, and fees.
- **Example**: `1,000 BPS` = `10%`.

### Health Factor (HF)
- **Definition**: A numeric representation of the safety of a user's borrow position. A position is healthy if its health factor is greater than 1.0.
- **Scale**: `10,000` = `1.0`.
- **Threshold**: Below `10,000` means the position is eligible for liquidation.
- **Formula**: `health_factor = (collateral_value * liquidation_threshold_bps / 10000) * 10000 / debt_value`.
- **Special Case**: A position with no debt has a sentinel health factor of `100,000,000`.

### Close Factor
- **Definition**: The maximum proportion of a distressed borrower's debt that a liquidator can repay in a single transaction.
- **Scale**: Basis points (`5,000` = `50%`).
- **Safety Limit**: Usually capped at `7,500` (75%) to prevent total wipeout in a single block.

### Reserve Factor
- **Definition**: The percentage of interest paid by borrowers that is redirected to the protocol treasury rather than distributed to lenders.
- **Scale**: Basis points (`1,000` = `10%`).
- **Range**: `0 - 5,000 BPS` (0% - 50%).

### Utilization Rate
- **Definition**: The ratio of total borrowed funds to total deposited funds for a given asset.
- **Scale**: Basis points (`8,000` = `80%`).
- **Formula**: `utilization = (total_borrows * 10,000) / total_deposits`.
- **Impact**: Higher utilization typically triggers higher interest rates via the "kink" model.

### Minimum Collateral Ratio (MCR)
- **Definition**: The minimum ratio of collateral value to debt value that a user must maintain to stay in good standing.
- **Scale**: Basis points (`11,000` = `110%`).
- **Requirement**: Users cannot withdraw collateral or borrow more if it would push their ratio below the MCR.

### Liquidation Threshold
- **Definition**: The specific collateral ratio at which a borrower is considered distressed and eligible for liquidation.
- **Scale**: Basis points (`10,500` = `105%`).
- **Invariant**: Must always be less than or equal to the MCR.

### Liquidation Incentive (Bonus)
- **Definition**: The bonus given to liquidators for helping clear bad debt from the protocol. It is paid out in the borrower's collateral at a discount.
- **Scale**: Basis points (`1,000` = `10%`).
- **Example**: A 10% incentive means a liquidator receives $110 worth of collateral for every $100 of debt repaid.

## Numeric Scales Summary

| Term | Scale | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Percentages (BPS) | `10,000 = 100%` | `500 = 5%` |
| Health Factor | `10,000 = 1.0` | `12,500 = 1.25` |
| Utilization | `10,000 = 100%` | `8,000 = 80%` |
| Oracle Price | `100,000,000 = 1.0` | `10^8` scaling |

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Rounding Directions
- **Debt/Interest**: The protocol generally **rounds up** (favors the protocol/lenders) when calculating interest and debt to prevent dust accumulation and ensure solvency.
- **Collateral**: The protocol generally **rounds down** (favors the protocol) when calculating maximum borrowable amounts.

### 2. Decimal Scaling
- Different tokens on Stellar have different decimals (e.g., XLM has 7, others may have 8, 12, or 14).
- Always normalize to a common scale (usually 18 decimals internally or using the oracle's 8-decimal scale) before performing cross-asset comparisons.
- **Example**: Comparing 100 XLM (7 decimals) to 100 USDC (6 decimals) requires scaling both to a common denominator.

### 3. Stale Prices
- Health factors and liquidation eligibility depend on oracle prices.
- Integrators should check the `last_updated` timestamp of prices. The protocol enforces a Heartbeat/TTL, but frontends should provide visual cues for stale data.

### 4. Health Factor vs. Collateral Ratio
- **Collateral Ratio** is `Collateral Value / Debt Value`.
- **Health Factor** is `(Collateral Value * Liquidation Threshold) / Debt Value`.
- A position is liquidatable when `Collateral Ratio < Liquidation Threshold`, which is equivalent to `Health Factor < 1.0`.

## `stellar-lend-common` Crate

The `stellar-lend-common` crate (`stellar-lend/contracts/common/`) is the single source of truth for shared protocol primitives. All other crates in the workspace should import from here rather than redefining their own versions.

### Exports

| Symbol | Kind | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `BPS_DENOM` | `const i128` | Basis-point denominator — `10_000` (= 100 %). Every percentage in the protocol is expressed as `value * rate_bps / BPS_DENOM`. |
| `LendingError` | `enum` | Canonical on-chain error enum. Variant codes are stable — adding new variants is backward-compatible, but existing codes must never change. |
| `scale_bps(value, rate_bps)` | `fn` | Checked `value * rate_bps / BPS_DENOM`. Returns `None` on overflow. |
| `unscale_bps(value, rate_bps)` | `fn` | Inverse: checked `value * BPS_DENOM / rate_bps`. Returns `None` if `rate_bps == 0` or on overflow. |

### `LendingError` Wire Codes

| Variant | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `InvalidAmount` | 1001 | Amount must be positive and non-zero |
| `Overflow` | 1002 | Arithmetic would overflow `i128` |
| `Unauthorized` | 1003 | Caller is not authorised |
| `BelowMinimumBorrow` | 1008 | Borrow amount is below the protocol minimum |
| `NotInitialized` | 1009 | Contract has not been initialised |
| `AlreadyInitialized` | 1010 | `initialize` called more than once |
| `PositionHealthy` | 1011 | Liquidation refused — position is healthy |
| `DebtCeilingExceeded` | 2001 | Borrow would exceed the protocol debt ceiling |
| `DepositCapExceeded` | 2002 | Deposit would exceed the asset deposit cap |
| `InvalidFeeBps` | 2005 | Flash-loan fee is outside the permitted range |
| `InsufficientCollateral` | 2007 | Withdrawal exceeds available collateral |

### Migration Guide for Callers

Previously each crate declared its own `LendingError` or `Error` enum. To migrate:

1. Add `stellar-lend-common = { path = "../common" }` to your `Cargo.toml`.
2. Replace any local `LendingError` / `Error` definitions with:
   ```rust
   pub use stellar_lend_common::{BPS_DENOM, LendingError};
   ```
3. Replace all inline BPS denominators (`10_000`, `10000`) with `BPS_DENOM`.
4. Use `scale_bps` / `unscale_bps` for checked percentage arithmetic instead of
   hand-written `checked_mul` / `checked_div` pairs.
